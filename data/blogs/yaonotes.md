summary: A brief Hello World and Blog Test
-------

Hello world!

After several weeks struggling with previous notes collection site, I finally decided to build a purely static, cookie-free, and intensive websites to share my notes and writings during my study.

## What it is.

It is my personal index, where I could save all my works, including manuscripts, projects, datasets and lecture notes. 

## What is is not.

It does not host any file directly, instead, it saves file in other third-party providers, such as GitHub/OSF. Therefore, you may sometimes encounter problems if their service in in outage.
